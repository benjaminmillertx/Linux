# Simple OSINT-like file search tool for Linux
# Usage: ./osint-file-search.sh "keyword"

KEYWORD="$1"

# 1. Search for filenames that contain the keyword
echo "📁 Matching filenames:"
find / -type f -iname "*$KEYWORD*" 2>/dev/null

# 2. Search inside text files for keyword
echo
echo "📝 Searching inside files (grep):"
grep -Ril --exclude-dir={/proc,/sys,/dev,/run,/var/lib/docker,/var/lib/snapd,/snap} "$KEYWORD" / 2>/dev/null

# 3. Check file metadata (PDFs, images, etc.)
echo
echo "📂 Searching metadata (PDF, JPG, PNG):"
find / -type f \( -iname "*.pdf" -o -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.png" \) 2>/dev/null | while read -r file; do
    if exiftool "$file" 2>/dev/null | grep -iq "$KEYWORD"; then
        echo "📸 Match found in metadata: $file"
    fi
done

# 4. Optional: Check file hash matches (basic IOC matching)
# You can extend this by maintaining a hashlist of known indicators

echo
echo "✅ Search complete."

✅ Requirements:

    exiftool must be installed (for metadata scanning):

    sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl

🧠 What It Does:

    Searches filenames

    Greps file contents

    Scans metadata in PDFs and images

🛡️ Note:

This script runs a lot of filesystem searches. For deep scans, you might want to run it with sudo and during off-hours to avoid performance hits.
