# Purpose: This script suggests possible Linux kernel exploits based on system architecture and kernel version.
#          It works by comparing the system kernel version to known exploits in various databases.

# Function to check if the system is running with root privileges

# Function to suggest exploits based on kernel version

    # Placeholder for actual exploit suggestion logic (to be filled with exploit-checking logic)
    # For example, a real-world script would check kernel versions against known vulnerability databases.

        echo "Suggested exploit: Exploit-Y for kernel 5.4"
    else
        echo "No known exploits found for this kernel version."

# Function to check architecture and suggest architecture-specific exploits

        # Add specific exploit checks for ARM
    else
        echo "No architecture-specific exploits found."
