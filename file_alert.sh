Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller. To create a system that sends an email alert when a specific text file is accessed on a Linux system, you can use a combination of tools such as inotify, mail, and cron. Here's a basic example:
Install the inotify-tools package:
You can install inotify-tools on Ubuntu using the following command:
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
Create a script that sends an email when the file is accessed:
Create a script called file_alert.sh with the following content:
#!/bin/bash

FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/file.txt"
EMAIL="your_email@example.com"

if [ -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
 inotifywait -e open "$FILE_PATH" --format '%w%f' | while read FILE
 do
 echo "File $FILE has been accessed" | mail -s "File Access Alert" $EMAIL
 done
fi
Replace /path/to/your/file.txt with the path to the file you want to monitor, and your_email@example.com with the email address where you want to receive the alerts.
Make the script executable:
chmod +x file_alert.sh
Schedule the script to run periodically:
You can use cron to run the script every minute. Edit the crontab file using the following command:
crontab -e
Add the following line to the file:
* * * * * /path/to/your/file_alert.sh
Replace /path/to/your/file_alert.sh with the path to the file_alert.sh script.
Test the script:
To test the script, open the monitored file using a text editor or a command such as cat or less. After a few seconds, you should receive an email alert.
Note that this is a basic example, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs. For example, you can add additional checks to the script, such as verifying the user who accessed the file, or sending different alerts based on the type of access. You can also use other email tools, such as sendmail, to send the alerts.

 To modify the Linux tripwire to capture the IP address of the person who accessed the text file and send it in an email, you can use the last command to check the last login of the user and extract the IP address. Here's an example of how you can modify the file_alert.sh script to include the IP address:
#!/bin/bash

FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/file.txt"
EMAIL="your_email@example.com"

if [ -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
 inotifywait -e open "$FILE_PATH" --format '%w%f' | while read FILE
 do
 # Get the username and IP address of the last login
 LAST_LOGIN=$(last | grep pts/ | grep $(whoami) | tail -n 1)
 USERNAME=$(echo $LAST_LOGIN | awk '{print $1}')
 IP_ADDRESS=$(echo $LAST_LOGIN | awk '{print $3}')

 # Send the email alert
 echo "File $FILE has been accessed by user $USERNAME with IP address $IP_ADDRESS" | mail -s "File Access Alert" $EMAIL
 done
fi
In this modified script, the last command is used to check the last login of the user who accessed the file. The grep command is used to filter the output and extract the last login that matches the current user and a pseudo terminal (pts/). The awk command is used to extract the username and IP address from the last login.
Note that this script assumes that the user accessed the file through a pseudo terminal (pts/), and may not work correctly if the user accessed the file through a different method (e.g., directly through the terminal emulator). You may need to modify the script to handle different cases or use a different method to capture the IP address.
