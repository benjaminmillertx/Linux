ðŸ§  Explanation

    op=2: Specifies an ARP reply (not a request).

    pdst: The IP address of the machine you are pretending to respond to (the victim).

    hwdst: The MAC address of that machine.

    hwsrc: The fake MAC address you're claiming the sender has.

    psrc: The IP address you're spoofing (e.g., pretending to be the router).

ðŸ›¡ Use Cases for Legal Testing

Use this only:

    In your own test lab using virtual machines.

    In Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

    In ethical hacking courses where the network is controlled.

    With a signed agreement in corporate penetration tests.

ðŸ§ª Want to Test in a Lab?

If you're using Kali Linux, you can set up a legal lab with:

    A Kali VM.

    A Windows or Linux victim VM on the same virtual LAN.

    Wireshark to monitor ARP traffic.

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to forward packets if needed.
