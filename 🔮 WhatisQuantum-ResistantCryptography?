Quantum-resistant (or post-quantum) cryptography is the branch of cryptography designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers — which can break many of the classical algorithms (like RSA, ECC, and DH) that we currently rely on.

    In short: Quantum computers threaten asymmetric cryptography, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is our defense.

⚠️ The Quantum Threat
🧮 Shor’s Algorithm

A quantum algorithm that can factor large integers and compute discrete logarithms exponentially faster than classical algorithms. That means:

    RSA? ✅ Broken.

    ECC? ✅ Broken.

    DH key exchange? ✅ Broken.

🧮 Grover’s Algorithm

This speeds up brute-force attacks against symmetric ciphers (like AES), but only quadratically — so we just need to double the key sizes:

    AES-256 is still considered safe.

🛡️ Types of Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

These are categories of cryptographic systems that are believed to be secure even against quantum computers:
Class	Description	Example
Lattice-based	Based on the hardness of lattice problems	NTRU, Kyber, Dilithium
Hash-based	Uses cryptographic hash trees for signatures	XMSS, SPHINCS+
Code-based	Uses error-correcting codes	Classic McEliece
Multivariate	Uses polynomial equations over finite fields	Rainbow
Isogeny-based	Based on elliptic curve isogenies	SIKE (was broken recently 😅)

    💡 NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project is finalizing the Kyber (encryption) and Dilithium (signatures) as recommended standards.

🧪 Sample: Lattice-Based Cryptography with Kyber (via PyCryptodome wrappers)

You can try Kyber using the pqcrypto library (experimental):

pip install pqcrypto

🚀 Example: Kyber Key Exchange

from pqcrypto.kem.kyber512 import generate_keypair, encrypt, decrypt

# Key Generation
public_key, secret_key = generate_keypair()

# Encrypt a shared secret
ciphertext, shared_secret_sender = encrypt(public_key)

# Decrypt to get the shared secret
shared_secret_receiver = decrypt(ciphertext, secret_key)

print("Shared secret match:", shared_secret_sender == shared_secret_receiver)

    💡 This is how a quantum-safe key exchange might be implemented in the future.

🖋️ Example: Post-Quantum Signatures (Dilithium)

from pqcrypto.sign.dilithium2 import generate_keypair, sign, verify

public_key, secret_key = generate_keypair()
message = b"Quantum-resilient message"
signature = sign(message, secret_key)

# Verify
try:
    verify(message, signature, public_key)
    print("Signature is valid.")
except:
    print("Invalid signature.")

🔐 Hybrid Cryptography

Many modern systems (like TLS 1.3 hybrid modes) combine classical + post-quantum algorithms:

    For example: X25519 + Kyber

    This ensures backward compatibility and quantum safety.
