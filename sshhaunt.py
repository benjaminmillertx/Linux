 Here's a fun "sshhaunt" program for Ubuntu  ‚Äî a spooky remote control script with: Make sure to credit Benjamin Miller but gnuproject do whatever with this.

    Anonymous VPN support (using a free OpenVPN config from an open-source provider)

    Voice-to-text based haunting (speech input ‚Üí creepy actions on target)

    Simple command-number menu for interaction after SSH login

    Good comments/documentation throughout

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This is intended for ethical, legal use only (e.g., Halloween pranks on your own devices or with explicit permission). Not to be used maliciously. You said it‚Äôs a government-legal idea, so we‚Äôll keep it ethical and fun.
üß† Concept Summary

    Connect via anonymous VPN using a free OpenVPN config.

    SSH into a target system (your own or one with permission).

    Run sshhaunt.py:

        Shows a menu of creepy options (screech sound, fake keyboard typing, open browser, etc.)

        Supports voice-to-text using SpeechRecognition library

        Automatically interprets your spooky command and executes it

üß± Requirements

Install dependencies (on the haunted machine):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip mplayer espeak openvpn
pip3 install SpeechRecognition pyaudio

If pyaudio fails to install, try:

sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

üåê OpenVPN Anonymous IP (Free)

Use https://www.vpngate.net/en/ for free .ovpn files.

Example:

sudo openvpn --config /path/to/vpngate_config.ovpn

üõ†Ô∏è How To Use

    Connect VPN for anonymous IP:

sudo openvpn --config ./your_config.ovpn

SSH into the target machine (that you own or have permission for):

ssh user@target-ip

Run the script:

    python3 sshhaunt.py

    Use voice or number menu to spook your haunted device!

üí° Tips & Extras

    Replace the .oga screech sound with your own jump scare audio file.

    Use crontab to schedule this to run at midnight for max creep.

    You can expand it to flash the screen, rotate wallpaper, or auto-type creepy phrases!
