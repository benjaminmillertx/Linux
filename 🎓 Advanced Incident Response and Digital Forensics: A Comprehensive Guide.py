🔐 Python: Incident Response Workflow

# Basic IR workflow outline in Python
def identify_incident():
    print("[+] Identifying the security incident...")

def contain_incident():
    print("[+] Containing the threat to prevent propagation...")

def eradicate_threat():
    print("[+] Eradicating the root cause of the incident...")

def recover_systems():
    print("[+] Restoring services and verifying integrity...")

🧪 3. Digital Forensics Fundamentals
🧷 Core Concepts

    Chain of Custody: Always maintain a verifiable log of access to evidence.

    Evidence Preservation: Use bit-for-bit copies and write blockers.

    Data Acquisition: Memory, disks, volatile logs.

💾 4. Forensic Investigation Techniques
🧠 Memory Forensics (Volatility)

# Requires Volatility 2.x compatible plugin structure
from volatility.plugins.taskmods import psscan
from volatility import conf, registry

def analyze_memory(image_path):
    config = conf.ConfObject()
    config.parse_options()
    config.PROFILE = "Win7SP1x64"
    config.LOCATION = f"file://{image_path}"
    
    scan = psscan.PSScan(config)
    for task in scan.calculate():
        print(f"Process: {task.ImageFileName}, PID: {task.UniqueProcessId}")

💿 Disk Forensics (PyTSK)

import pytsk3

def analyze_file_system(disk_image):
    img_info = pytsk3.Img_Info(disk_image)
    fs = pytsk3.FS_Info(img_info)
    
    directory = fs.open_dir(path="/")
    for entry in directory:
        name = entry.info.name.name.decode('utf-8')
        if entry.info.meta and entry.info.meta.type == pytsk3.TSK_FS_META_TYPE_REG:
            print(f"File: {name}, Size: {entry.info.meta.size}")

🌐 5. Network Forensics
📡 Packet Capture with Scapy

from scapy.all import sniff

def analyze_packets(interface="eth0"):
    print("[*] Sniffing 10 packets from interface...")
    packets = sniff(iface=interface, count=10)
    for pkt in packets:
        print(pkt.summary())

🔬 6. Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering
🔧 Static and Dynamic Techniques

    Static: File strings, hashes, PE analysis.

    Dynamic: Sandboxing, monitoring network and registry behavior.

📝 7. Reporting & Legal Aspects
⚖️ Legal Guidelines

    Familiarize yourself with jurisdictional laws regarding data access and evidence use.

    Always obtain proper authorization before beginning an investigation.

🧑‍⚖️ Ethics

    Uphold professional integrity.

    Ensure privacy and limit your scope to what is authorized.

🧠 Final Commentary

This course doesn't just teach you what to do — it teaches you how to think like a digital investigator. It's about mindset, discipline, and leveraging automation responsibly. The Python scripts serve as building blocks; from here, you can integrate with frameworks like Volatility3, Plaso, or even build out full toolchains.
✅ Pro Tips:

    Document every action — your logbook is your lifeline.

    Always validate findings with multiple sources.

    Use hashes (MD5/SHA256) to ensure data integrity.
