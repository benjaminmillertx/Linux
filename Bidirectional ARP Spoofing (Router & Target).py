ðŸ§  How It Works
Concept

You're performing bidirectional ARP spoofing:

    Tell the target that you (attacker) are the router.

    Tell the router that you (attacker) are the target.

This places your machine in the middle of all traffic â€” MITM attack.
ARP Operation Codes

    op=1: ARP Request (who has IP x.x.x.x?)

    op=2: ARP Reply (IP x.x.x.x is at MAC xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)
