1. üõ∞Ô∏è Understanding Satellite Communication Security
What‚Äôs at stake?

    Military-grade and commercial satellites are critical infrastructure.

    Compromising satellite links can lead to:

        Eavesdropping

        Signal jamming

        Spoofing of telemetry or GPS

        Command injection attacks

Common vulnerabilities:

    Insecure modems/terminals

    Unencrypted command channels

    Weak authentication

    Outdated firmware or misconfigurations

2. üêç Python Fundamentals for SATCOM Security

Install these libraries to get started:

pip install pyserial scapy pandas matplotlib gnuradio

Key libraries:
Library	Purpose
pyserial	Serial port communication
scapy	Packet capture and manipulation
pandas	Data analysis and structuring
matplotlib	Visualization of results
gnuradio	SDR (Software Defined Radio) operations
3. üîç Reconnaissance with Python
Example: Serial Recon of Satellite Modem

import serial

port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
baud_rate = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(port, baud_rate)
ser.write(b'ATI\r\n')  # 'ATI' for modem info
response = ser.read(100)
print(f"Device Info:\n{response.decode()}")
ser.close()

4. üß© Vulnerability Assessment in SATCOM

Analyze responses to AT commands or binary protocols:

    Enumerate capabilities

    Test for input validation

    Observe whether commands are authenticated

Example:

commands = [b'AT\r\n', b'AT+STATUS\r\n', b'AT+GPSLOC\r\n']

for cmd in commands:
    ser.write(cmd)
    print(f"Command: {cmd.decode().strip()}")
    print("Response:", ser.readline().decode().strip())

5. üí• Exploitation and Countermeasures
Potential Exploits (Simulated):

    Bypassing AT command authentication

    Overwriting system memory

    Enabling debug or dev mode

Countermeasures:

    Use encrypted communication (AES over RF)

    Disable unused services and ports

    Implement hardware-backed authentication

6. üì° Packet Sniffing with Scapy

Capture TCP/UDP satellite traffic:

from scapy.all import sniff

def analyze_packet(packet):
    if packet.haslayer("IP"):
        print(packet.summary())

sniff(iface='eth0', filter='ip', prn=analyze_packet, count=50)

7. üìª Advanced SDR Sniffing (GNU Radio)
Python-based Flowgraph Using gnuradio:

from gnuradio import gr, blocks, analog, uhd

class SatFlow(gr.top_block):
    def __init__(self):
        gr.top_block.__init__(self)
        self.source = uhd.usrp_source("addr=192.168.10.2", uhd.stream_args('fc32'))
        self.sink = blocks.null_sink(gr.sizeof_gr_complex)
        self.connect(self.source, self.sink)

flow = SatFlow()
flow.start()
time.sleep(10)
flow.stop()

üìå Use SDRs like HackRF, USRP, or RTL-SDR for capturing raw SATCOM signals.
8. üîê Best Practices for Securing Satellite Systems

    Use strong crypto protocols (e.g., AES-256, RSA-4096)

    Apply firmware validation and secure boot

    Monitor telemetry for anomalies

    Train operators in incident response

    Audit ground station and terminal firmware regularly

üß† Bonus: Combine Serial and Packet Sniffing

import serial
from scapy.all import sniff

def read_serial():
    ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)
    ser.write(b'AT+DIAG\r\n')
    print(ser.readline().decode())
    ser.close()

def packet_callback(pkt):
    if pkt.haslayer('UDP'):
        print("[Packet]:", pkt.summary())

read_serial()
sniff(filter="udp", prn=packet_callback, count=10)

üß∞ Tools & Hardware You Can Explore
Tool/Hardware	Purpose
RTL-SDR	Entry-level signal sniffing
HackRF One	SDR for transmit & receive
USRP	Professional-grade SDR
SDR#, GQRX	Visualization of RF spectrum
X-Loader, Minicom	Serial comm & firmware uploads
