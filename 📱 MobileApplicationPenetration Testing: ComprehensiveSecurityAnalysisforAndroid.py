üß© Course Overview

In today's hyperconnected digital world, mobile apps are not just tools‚Äîthey're extensions of users' lives. With this increasing reliance comes a growing surface for cyber threats. This course equips aspiring security professionals with practical, step-by-step techniques for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in Android and iOS applications.

From reverse engineering APKs to uncovering weak data storage practices, you'll learn hands-on techniques used by ethical hackers to simulate real-world attacks and help development teams secure their mobile apps proactively.
üõ†Ô∏è Course Modules & Techniques
üîê 1. Fundamentals of Mobile App Security

    Understanding mobile architecture (Android/iOS)

    Threat modeling for mobile platforms

    Secure coding & development lifecycle (SDLC)

    Overview of OWASP Mobile Top 10 vulnerabilities

üïµÔ∏è 2. Setting Up Your Penetration Testing Lab

    Android Studio Emulator or Genymotion

    Frida, Burp Suite, MobSF, jadx, apktool, ADB, Wireshark

    Jailbroken iOS or rooted Android devices (for deeper testing)

    ‚úÖ Note: Always have proper authorization before testing. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.

üß™ Penetration Testing Techniques
üì¶ Reverse Engineering & Code Analysis (Android)

Disassemble Android APKs to understand app logic:

apktool d target-app.apk
jadx-gui target-app.apk

What to look for:

    Hardcoded credentials or API keys

    Unprotected activities/services

    Poorly implemented cryptography

üì° Network Traffic Interception (MITM)

Inspect communication between the app and backend using Burp Suite or mitmproxy:

    Install custom certificate on device/emulator

    Use proxy listener on port 8080

    Bypass SSL Pinning with Frida:

frida -U -n com.example.app -l frida-ssl-bypass.js

üß¨ Data Storage Audit

Test for insecure local storage, e.g., plaintext sensitive data:

adb shell
cd /data/data/com.example.app/shared_prefs/
cat user_prefs.xml

Look for:

    PII or tokens stored without encryption

    Use of MODE_WORLD_READABLE in files

üîç Real-World Threat Simulations
1. SQL Injection Prevention in Python (Server-Side API Security)

import re

def sanitize_input(user_input):
    return re.sub(r'[;\'"\\/]', '', user_input)

user_input = input("Enter username: ")
secure_input = sanitize_input(user_input)

Commentary:
While mobile apps may not directly execute SQL, unvalidated input sent to backend APIs can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This snippet shows how to sanitize strings‚Äîbasic but educational.
2. Secure Authentication with Argon2 (Python)

import argon2

def hash_password(password):
    ph = argon2.PasswordHasher()
    return ph.hash(password)

def verify_password(password, hash):
    ph = argon2.PasswordHasher()
    return ph.verify(hash, password)

Why Argon2?
It's memory-hard and GPU-resistant‚Äîideal against brute-force attempts common in leaked credential databases.
3. SSL/TLS Configuration for Secure Communication (Python)

import ssl

def create_tls_context():
    context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
    context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1 | ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1
    context.load_cert_chain(certfile='cert.pem', keyfile='key.pem')
    return context

Use Case:
Secure communication between mobile apps and APIs is essential. This server-side snippet enforces modern TLS and avoids legacy, vulnerable protocols.
4. OWASP Java Encoder for Safe Output Rendering (Java)

import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;

String userInput = request.getParameter("input");
String safeHtml = Encode.forHtml(userInput);

Why it matters:
Mobile apps often embed WebViews. Any user-generated content rendered inside these views must be encoded to avoid XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
üß† Advanced Topics

    Runtime Instrumentation using Frida

    Memory Tampering & Hooking Functions

    Bypassing Root/Jailbreak Detection

    Smali Code Injection

    Traffic Manipulation & Token Replay

üö® Ethical Considerations

    This course is intended strictly for educational and authorized penetration testing. Always have explicit written consent before assessing an application or network. Unethical or unauthorized testing can result in severe legal consequences.

üìö Summary & Key Takeaways

    Understand the attack surface of mobile apps, from insecure storage to broken cryptography.

    Learn to decompile and reverse engineer Android apps using open-source tools.

    Use network proxies and runtime instrumentation to analyze app behavior dynamically.

    Implement secure development practices with examples of safe input handling, password hashing, and communication protocols.

    Security is not a feature. It's a continuous process that starts at development and never truly ends.
