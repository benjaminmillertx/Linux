üß† Explanation: How BB84 Works

    Random Bit Generation (Alice):
    Alice generates a random string of bits (0 or 1).

    Random Basis Selection (Alice):
    For each bit, Alice also randomly chooses a basis:

        Z basis (standard) ‚Üí measure normally.

        X basis (Hadamard) ‚Üí apply Hadamard gate before measurement.

    Quantum State Preparation:
    Each qubit is encoded according to the bit value and basis:

        0 in Z ‚Üí |0‚ü©

        1 in Z ‚Üí |1‚ü©

        0 in X ‚Üí |+‚ü© (superposition)

        1 in X ‚Üí |‚àí‚ü© (inverse superposition)

    Transmission and Measurement (Bob):
    Bob receives the qubits and randomly chooses his own basis to measure them. He doesn‚Äôt know Alice‚Äôs basis.

    Basis Reconciliation:
    Alice and Bob communicate publicly (e.g., over the internet) and compare their basis choices. They discard all bits where the bases were different.

    Key Extraction:
    The remaining bits (where both used the same basis) are called the sifted key and are used for encryption.

üîê Why BB84 Is Secure

    If an eavesdropper (Eve) tries to measure the qubits, she doesn‚Äôt know the correct basis and introduces errors.

    Alice and Bob can check for these errors by revealing a small subset of their sifted key.

    If too many errors are found, they know the channel was compromised.
