üß† Foundational Concepts

Cryptography is a cornerstone of cybersecurity. It allows ethical hackers to:

    Encrypt sensitive data to maintain confidentiality.

    Generate hashes to verify data integrity.

    Use digital signatures to prove authenticity and non-repudiation.

    Secure communication over insecure channels with protocols like TLS and SSH.

üß™ Hands-On Cryptography with Python

    Note: Install the required libraries using:

pip install pycryptodome ecdsa

üîí AES Encryption (CBC Mode with Padding)

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad

# AES uses a block size of 16 bytes
key = get_random_bytes(16)  # 128-bit key
iv = get_random_bytes(16)   # Initialization Vector

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

plaintext = b"This is a secret message"
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(plaintext, AES.block_size))

# Decrypt
decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
decrypted = unpad(decipher.decrypt(ciphertext), AES.block_size)

print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext)
print("Decrypted:", decrypted)

üîê RSA Key Generation and Encryption with OAEP

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

# Generate 2048-bit RSA key pair
key = RSA.generate(2048)
public_key = key.publickey()

cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
plaintext = b"This is a secret message"
ciphertext = cipher_rsa.encrypt(plaintext)

# Decrypt with private key
decipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
decrypted = decipher_rsa.decrypt(ciphertext)

print("Encrypted:", ciphertext)
print("Decrypted:", decrypted)

üßÆ Hashing with SHA-256

import hashlib

message = b"This is a message to hash"
hash_value = hashlib.sha256(message).hexdigest()

print("SHA-256 Hash:", hash_value)

üñãÔ∏è Digital Signatures with RSA

from Crypto.Signature import pkcs1_15
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

key = RSA.generate(2048)
message = b"This is a message to sign"
hash_obj = SHA256.new(message)

# Sign
signature = pkcs1_15.new(key).sign(hash_obj)

# Verify
try:
    pkcs1_15.new(key.publickey()).verify(hash_obj, signature)
    print("Signature is valid.")
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    print("Signature is invalid.")

üí° ECC Signatures with ecdsa (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

from ecdsa import SigningKey, NIST256p

# Generate private/public key pair using ECC
private_key = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST256p)
public_key = private_key.get_verifying_key()

message = b"This is a message to sign"
signature = private_key.sign(message)

# Verify signature
if public_key.verify(signature, message):
    print("ECDSA signature is valid.")
else:
    print("ECDSA signature is invalid.")

üì° Cryptographic Protocols Overview
üîê SSL/TLS

    Provides end-to-end encrypted communication over HTTPS.

    Prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

üîê IPSec

    Secures IP packets using encryption and authentication headers.

    Common in VPN technologies.

üîê SSH

    Used for secure remote administration and encrypted file transfer.

    Replaces insecure protocols like Telnet.
